This is my submission for the Frontend Development Internship Assignment.
In this project, I’ve created a Design System using React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS, along with Storybook for component testing and documentation.

The main idea was to build a set of reusable, consistent, and scalable UI components that can be easily maintained and used across different projects. I’ve focused on writing clean and understandable code, following modern frontend practices, and ensuring responsiveness and accessibility in the components.

As a student, this project helped me explore how real-world design systems work, and I thoroughly enjoyed working on it. Thank you for the opportunity!
